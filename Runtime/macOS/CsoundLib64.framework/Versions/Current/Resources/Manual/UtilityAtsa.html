        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <p>ATS analysis was devised by Juan Pampin. For complete
    information on ATS visit: <a class="ulink" href="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/~juan/ATS.html" target="_top">http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/~juan/ATS.html</a>.
    </p>
        <p>Analysis parameters must be carefully tuned for the Analysis
    Algorithm (ATSA) to properly capture the nature of the signal to
    be analyzed. As there are a significant number of them, ATSH
    offers the possibility of Saving/Loading them in a Binary File
    carrying the extension "*.apf". The extension is not mandatory,
    but recommended. A brief explanation of each Analysis Parameters
    follows:
    </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Start (secs.): the starting time of the analysis in seconds.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Duration (secs.): the duration time of the analysis in
    seconds. A zero means the whole duration of the input sound file.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Lowest Frequency (Hz.): this parameter will partially
    determine the size of the Analysis Window to be used. To compute
    the size of the Analysis Window, the period of the Lowest
    Frequency in samples (SR / LF) is multiplied by the number of
    cycles of it the user wants to fit in the Analysis Window (see
    parameter 6). This value is rounded to the next power of two to
    determine the size of the FFT for the analysis. The remaining
    samples are zero-padded. If the signal is a single, harmonic
    sound, then the value of the Lowest Frequency should be its
    fundamental frequency or a sub-harmonic of it. If it is not
    harmonic, then its lowest significant frequency component may be a
    good starting value.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Highest Frequency (Hz.): highest frequency to be taken
    into account for Peak Detection. Once it is determined that no
    relevant information is found beyond a certain frequency, the
    analysis may be faster and more accurate setting the Highest
    Frequency parameter to that value.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Frequency Deviation (Ratio): frequency deviation
    allowed for each peak in the Peak Continuation Algorithm, as a
    ratio of the frequency involved. For instance, considering a peak
    at 440 Hz and a Deviation of .1 will produce that the Peak
    Continuation Algorithm will only try to find candidates for its
    continuation between 396 and 484 Hz (10% above and below the
    frequency of the peak). A small value is likely to produce more
    trajectories whilst a large value will reduce them, but at the
    cost of rendering information difficult to be further processed.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Number of Cycles of Lowest Frequency to fit in
    Analysis Window: this will also partially determine the size of
    the Fourier Analysis Window to be used. See Parameter 3. For
    single harmonic signals, it is supposed to be more than one
    (typically 4).</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Hop Size (Ratio): size of the gap between one Analysis
    Window and the next expressed as a ratio of the Window Size. For
    instance, a Hop Size value of .25 will "jump" by 512 samples
    (Windows will overlap for a 75% of their size). This parameter
    will also determine the size of the analysis frames
    obtained. Signals that change their spectra very fast (such as
    Speech sounds) may need a high frame rate in order to properly
    track their changes.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Amplitude Threshold (dB): the highest amplitude value
    to be taken into account for Peak Detection.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Window Type: the shape of the smoothing function to be
    used for the Fourier Analysis. There are four choices available at
    present: Blackman, Blackman-Harris, Von Hann, and Hanning. Precise
    specifications about them are easily found on D.S.P. bibliography.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Track Length (Frames): The Peak Continuation Algorithm
    will "look-back" by Length frames in order to do its job better,
    preventing frequency trajectories from curving too much and
    loosing stability. However, a large value for this parameter will
    slow down the analysis significantly.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Minimal Segment Length (Frames): once the analysis is
    done, the spectral data can be further "cleaned" up during
    post-processing. Trajectories shorter than this value are
    suppressed if their average SMR is below Minimal Segment SMR (see
    parameters 16 and 14). This might help to avoid non-relevant
    sudden changes while keeping a high frame rate, reducing also the
    number of intermittent sinusoids during synthesis.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Minimal Gap Length (Frames): as parameter 11, this one
    is also used to clean up the data during post-processing. In this
    case, gaps (zero amplitude values, i.e. theoretical "silence")
    longer than Length frames are filled up with amplitude/frequency
    values obtained by linear interpolation of the adjacent active
    frames. This parameter prevents sudden interruptions of stable
    trajectories while keeping a high frame rate.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>SMR Threshold (dB SPL): also a post-processing
    parameter, the SMR Threshold is used to eliminate partials with
    low averages.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Minimal Segment SMR (dB SPL): this parameter is used
    in combination with parameter 11. Short segments with SMR average
    below this value will be removed during post-processing.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Last Peak Contribution (0 to 1): as explained in
    Parameter 10, the Peak Continuation Algorithm "looks-back" several
    number of frames to do its job better. This parameter will help to
    weight the contribution of the first precedent peak over the
    others. A zero value means that all precedent peaks (to the size
    of Parameter 10) are equally taken in account.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>SMR Contribution (0 to 1): In addition to the
    proximity in frequency of the peaks, the ATS Peak Continuation
    Algorithm may use psycho-acoustic information (the
    Signal-to-Mask-Ratio, or SMR) to improve the perceptual
    results. This parameter indicates how much the SMR information is
    used during tracking. For instance, a value of .5 makes the Peak
    Continuation Algorithm to use a 50% of SMR information and a 50%
    of Frequency Proximity information to decide which is the best
    candidate to continue a sinusoidal track.</p>

      Generates the ATS analysis file 'audiofile.ats' from the
    original 'audiofile.wav' file. It begins analysis from second 0.1
    of the file and the analysis is performed for 1 second
    thereafter. The lowest frequency stored is 100 Hz and the highest
    is 10kHz. A Hamming window is used for each analysis frame.
